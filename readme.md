## Eh?
Your phone is _fabulous_, and it knows it. But do you?

## I have no idea what's going on.
Do you promise to love your phone no matter what? Good. Because it just told you it doesn't want to be a phone anymore. It wants to be a mouse. It's been a _goddamned trackpad inside a phone's body_ this whole time.

## But what will the neighbors say?
Fuck em! In the meantime:
* Run `npm install` for the dependencies
* Create a local network on your machine
* Connect to this network on your phone
* Run `ifconfig en0` to get the IP address
* Fire up `node app.js`
* Navigate to the aforementioned IP on your phone (on port 8080)

## Zomg! My phone is a mouse!
I know! It can click and shit!
